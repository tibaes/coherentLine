# Visual Computing Assignment - UFBA Masters in Computer Science 2016.2

In this work, I coded the *Coherent Line Drawing* filter using C++11 and OpenCV 3.1.
See references and details in the **presentation.pdf**.

## Build

Simple run **make cohelines**. You need the OpenCV library to build and run. It was tested only with OpenCV 3.1. Also, it depends on pkg-config, make and g++ tools.

## Running

Run **./cohelines <image_path>**. I didn't coded the tunning parameters input, so you need to rebuild for each change in the algorithm parameters (or build the input yourself :D).
